# Raspberry Pi Setup and Management Workshop

## Sections

### Introduction

The intention of this workshop is to familiarise you with the setup, configuration, and maintence of the Raspberry Pi, with the intention of enabling zero-configuration, headless/autostart interactive kiosks/visualisation installations.

We will start off with a fairly run of the mill setup guide, move into more advanced configuration of [wifi](wifi-advanced.md), [automatic upgrades](automatic-upgrades.md), before finally getting a headless, autostarting service to display custom programs/exhibits, with or without a display attached.

This guide starts off very 'fixed' and instructional, and becomes increasing free-from as we go along. Please feel free to ask questions at any time, even if there specific to something you're working on rather than a core part of the workshop.

By the end of this session, we expect to have run through a range of potential use cases, solutions, and opportunities that the Raspberry Pi platform provides, and become familiar with the Raspberry Pi documentation so that you can build and customise your own appliances from scratch.
