# Remote Access

There are [many ways](remote-access/README.md) that you can remotely connect to your Pi, both on the same local network and from across the internet. 

For this session we're just going to focus on SSH, but we can come back and expand on this if there is time/interest at the end of the session.

Best of all, once we finish this session, we don't have to touch the Pi at all, and copying/pasting commands is a lot easier from your own machines!

## SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) is a service that can be used to perform administrative and control operations as if you were sitting at the Pi, but from another computer. 

Instructions for this live [here](remote-access/ssh/README.md)
